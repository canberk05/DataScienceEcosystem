#This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers
(3*4)+5


# In[2]:


days = 0
hours = 0
mins = 0

time = 200

#days = time / 1440
leftover_minutes = time % 1440
hours = leftover_minutes / 60

#mins = time - (day*1440) - (hours*60)
print(str(days) + "days, " + str(hours) + "hours, " + str(mins) + "mins")
